    <h1>Enhancement One</h1>
    <p>The first enhancement is centered around Data Display and Activity. For this I took my main calendar screen and completely revamped it. Originally it featured only the month of August 2024, I updated it to handle all twelve months of the year and began the process of storing all my data in a nested hashmap.
    My goal was to show that I could create a user friendly design that allowed them to move through each month of the year by changing the logic of my code to be user friendly. </p>

 <br><br>

 <p> Below is both the original and updated screen for the calendar app. The left is the original only featuring August and you can see the cluttered buttons and lack of understanding I had at the time. On the right, is the new updated screen that allows users to switch through any month in this calendar year. 
 The buttons were removed to help improve the user experience on this main screen, instead clicking a day would now take users to a unique day page.</p>
