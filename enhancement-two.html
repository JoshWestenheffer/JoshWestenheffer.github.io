    <h1>Enhancement Two</h1>

    <p>For this enhancement the theme was Algorithms and Data Structures. My work here consisted of creating an entirely new java file and xml to incorporate the text that users would enter into specific days of the calendar.
    This involved creating functions and new logic to efficiently store the user data I was receiving. First here is a look at the difference in data storage, with the incorporation of the user data screen. </p>
<br>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 10px;">
    <img src="files/enhance2/original-data-screen.png" alt="Original Data Display" style="width: 45%; max-width: 500px; height: auto;">
    <img src="files/enhance2/new-data-screen.png" alt="Updated Data Display" style="width: 45%; max-width: 500px; height: auto;">
</div>
 <br><br>

 <p> Now that this new page exists the data is being entered through the text box and then I need to save this. Originally the data was stored to a specific textview of the month, now it is being stored within the hashmap.
 The pictures below show the original add and delete logic which was to edit the calendar text. Storing data like this is an inefficient and ineffective solution when dealing with large amounts of user data, and multiple users. 
 The third picture shows the new solution that is built around storing the data efficiently within the nested hashmap. Specifically, the user data is the key to the inner hashmap which I can then transfer between files and later incorporated into the database.
 
 <br>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 10px;">
    <img src="files/enhance2/add-data-function.png" alt="Original Data Display" style="width: 45%; max-width: 600px; height: auto;">
    <img src="files/enhance2/delete-data-function.png" alt="Updated Data Display" style="width: 45%; max-width: 600px; height: auto;">
  <img src="files/enhance2/save-data-function.png" alt="Updated Data Display" style="width: 45%; max-width: 900px; height: auto;">
</div>

 <p> The outcomes I focused on for this enhancement begin with employing strategies for building collaborative environments for diverse audiences. Since the next enhancement focused on the database and internal storage of the app itself, this enhancement was my oppurtunity to fine tune my app for any user.
 It is easy to use and has a solid user experience for anyone who wants to use it. It can be used by multilple users for communication or collaboration and overall displays my ability to consider audiences of all backgrounds.
  The second outcome was designing and evluating computing solutions to solve problems using algorithmic principles. I created efficient solutions that require a lot less computing power and provide a large range of data. 
  My solution using a nested hashmap with solid coding practices created a great solution that
 allows me to host a wide array of users and tie their information to them efficiently. This outcome will be further expanded in the next enhancement with the help of my database.</p>
