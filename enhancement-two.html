    <h1>Enhancement Two</h1>

    <p>For this enhancement the theme was Algorithms and Data Structures. My work here consisted of creating an entirely new java file and xml to incorporate the text that users would enter into specific days of the calendar.
    This involved creating functions and new logic to efficiently store the user data I was receiving. First here is a look at the difference in data storage, with the incorporation of the user data screen. </p>

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 10px;">
    <img src="files/enhance2/original-data-screen.png" alt="Original Data Display" style="width: 45%; max-width: 500px; height: auto;">
    <img src="files/enhance2/new-data-screen.png" alt="Updated Data Display" style="width: 45%; max-width: 500px; height: auto;">
</div>
 <br><br>

 <p> Now that this new page exists the data is being entered through the text box and then I need to save this. Originally the data was stored to a specific textview of the month, now it is being stored within the hashmap.
 The pictures below show the original add and delete logic which was to edit the calendar text. Storing data like this is an inefficient and ineffective solution when dealing with large amounts of user data, and multiple users. 
 The third picture shows the new solution that is built around storing the data efficiently within the nested hashmap. Specifically, it is the key to the inner hashmap which I can then transfer between files and later incorporated into the database.
