       <p> The first outcome is all about <strong>"Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science‚Äù. </strong> 
    My final calendar is an easy to use, enjoyable user experience that does everything it is intended for. Users can store their data for dates and come back to it at any time. It features easy to use components with solid design choices. 
    There are plenty of ways teams could use it to communicate or to organize themselves, and this is just the beginning. </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>This entire project has led me to achieve the second outcome which is to <strong>"Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts".</strong> 
        My code features multiple files with complex functions and interconnection. All throughout this code you will find helpful comments and summarized explanations I took time to ensure were clear. Throughout my enhancement documentation I also provide extensive information on the code I added and changed.
        The functions are much more outlined there than on these pages, but that was the point. I wanted to show that I can summarize or explain my concepts in depth. This way I can speak to audiences of any sort and adapt myself to whatever is needed. </p>
    <br><br>
    <p> The third outcome was to <strong> "Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices".</strong> 
    This outcome played a role in my decision making before coding and during coding as well more than any other outcome. To make proper deign choices at times I realized I need to have failed with what I wanted to do originally. 
    I coded a few ideas and had to shift my focus once I realized a better way to do it. This never impeded my progress, only caused me to alter my course and create a better project. I have multiple algorithmic functions that use computer science best practices and solve problems for me. 
    These range from my month of the year calculations to my hashmap sorting. Overall, this outcome was my most prolific throughout the project.</p>
    <br><br>

    <p>The fourth outcome was to <strong> "Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals". </strong> 
    This step focuses heavily on the coding I did and the way I went about it. Firstly, I realized early on in my project that I was going to have a lot of interconnected code through my files. This was my driving force for achieving this goal as all of my functions are clear and valuable.
    I don't waste space using redundant code or have solutions that are poorly designed. While I won't sit here and say that my solutions are what perfection looks like I did a great job writing this code and it is concise, well written, and expandable. 
    Whether focusing on my solutions or my technique I was solid throughout this project.</p>
    <br><br>

    <p> The final outcome is security and primarily to <strong> "Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources". </strong>
    This was my weakest outcome throughout the project in terms of what I output. However, my mindset throughout the project was solid and I have plenty to show for it. My code features a separation of users throughout their own personal information. 
    Multiple users can have information throughout my code, and it will be separated and protected by their account. I made sure to create a login screen where a user can pick their own username and password to protect their data that I give a unique id to. 
    I understand this may not seem extensive, but my code is protecting their privacy and maintaining their security either way.</p>
